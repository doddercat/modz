# Modz Demo

This mod is just a simple demo that demonstrates how mod is developed and how it works.

You can follow this example and develop your own mod.

When you have developed your own mod, you may expect others to find and use it in doddercat. 

You can follow the example format and submit it in GitHub, and then everyone can find your mod in doddercat by searching your GitHub account name.
